# Music in Me

<strong>I'm a techno DJ and music producer known professionally as Frekler, originally from Kazan in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. 
My passion for <em>electronic music</em> started in the 1990s, during my early years as a pianist playing classical music concerts.</strong>

In 2001 I began DJing in Kazan and organizing cool parties with my friends - young DJ One and DJ Ozz at the Grot bar as part of the Prosound promo group. Over the next few years, I continued to develop my approach to techno music with gigs featuring an assertive and fat techno sound.

I'm proud of my ability to connect the energy and power of techno music with the hard sound of rock music, which led me to present a special <em>techno-industrial music set</em> at a rock festival in Kazan in 2003 - the first of its kind in the city and beyond. I've even had the opportunity to collaborate with rock guitarists in joint performances.

Since 2004, I've co-hosted the <em>OzoneChannel radio show</em> alongside the well-known DJ OM. The show, which has been on air since 1997, was one of the first in Russia to focus on night club culture and electronic music. It was founded by the famed OzonePro team from Kazan.

Thanks to the clubbing crowd my contributions to the development of club culture in Kazan were recognized when I was nominated for the "Dancing People Awards" in 2005.

As a supporter of the <em>underground scene</em>, I've performed at some of the best underground techno nightclubs in Russia, including the legendary <em>"TUNNEL" club</em> in Saint Petersburg (this club has sadly closed now and forever), promoted by famous DJ and producer Van Nosikov and others. 

I remain dedicated to discovering new horizons and actively promoting techno music through my studio work and the OzoneChannel radio show now. 

Geographically, I am currently in beautiful Spain.

Thank you for your support and stay tuned. <i class="fa fa-hand-peace"></i>
